### Intro

At some point in time I broke the my spouse's iPad Air Generation 4. The screen is in tact, but the digitizer needs to be replaced. I made the sketch below this past Wednesday, December 27, in support of my how-to-fix-an-iPad research. It's become an learning oppurtunity under a goal to better understand information technology.  Unfortunately, it's been nearly a year since I first promised to repair the iPad. Frusrated with my slow pace and procrastination, D, my spouse, started to repair the iPad last night. This blogpost is documentation of us finishing the job.

### Materials

- Silicon mat
- #000 Philips Screw Driver
- Tweezers
- IFIXIT Prying and Opening Tool Assortment 
  - Standard Spudger
  - Halberd Spudger
  - Opening Tool
  - Plastic Cards 
  - Opening Picks
- Sunction cups
- Heat gun
- Screen and digitizer replacement 
- Isopropyl Alchohol 
- Q-tips

### Process

We've used a handful of YouTube tutorials and this [IFIXITrepair guide](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iPad+Air+4+Screen+Replacement/156568) for guidance.

**Step 1:** D used the opening tool to pry between the edges of the screen and its Rose Gold backing. An adhesive holds the two together. The iPad was without power for this step. 

Some reccommend to apply a heating element such as a heat gun to warm the adhesive. And alternative to an opening tool one can use sunction cups. 

I was nervous about potentially damaging, with heat or mechanically, the 

- the ribbon cables 
- dispay edge
- light sensors
- camera module 
  
that sit milimeters away from the edge.

D also set aside a camera grommet.

**Step 2:** Remove the screws securing the battery connector to the logic board and screws securing the display and digitizer cables.

**Step 3:** Remove brackets 

**Step 4:** Remove screen

**Step 5:** Remove remaining adhesive with isopropyl alchohol and Q-tips

**Step 6:** Fasten ribbon cables from the new screen and digitizer to the iPad backing

**Step 7:** Screw brackets back in place

**Step 8:** Remove seal from edges of the new screen and digitzers and attach to iPad backing

### Conclusion

When we charged the iPad and the touch screen, unfortuanately, did not work. This may mean I fobbed Step 6 and did not properly fasten the digitzer cables. This mistake is costly and requires us restart the process by opening the hood again.
