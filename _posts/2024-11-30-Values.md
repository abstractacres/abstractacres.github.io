The purpose of this blog is to document me building tools to manage my garden. To guide my learning journey I've chosen the following 3 values:
 
### Accountability ### 

Whatever impact this blog will have it will be the result of responsible or irresponsible choices and behavior. As a blogger, I have the choice to take the time to:
- Research and fact-check
- Engage with feedback promptly 
- Use credible sources 
- Credit my sources
- Disclaim personal interests and biases
- Use respectful language 
- Follow WCAG or Section 508 technical standards

I willingly accept responsibility for my actions because I value accountability.

### Creativity ###

Creativity is bringing something into existence through a course of action. Encoding and recalling information is often how we view the process of learning, but creating something based on what we've learned can indicate great understanding. Writing for this blog and implementing ICTs in my garden are creative processes. 

### Sustainability ###

I define sustainability as the efficient use and management of Earth's resources for long-term, ecological, social, and economic health. I have the belief life on Earth can be in balance and harmony. My value of sustainability influences the problems I devote my time and energy to understanding and addressing.
