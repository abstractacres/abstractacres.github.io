### Intro

I've asked Google Bard to generate a math problem based off of the article, ["The number of wounded Israeli soldiers is mounting, representing a hidden cost of war"](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-gaza-war-wounded-soldiers-2b0357365480cc242e30794666b41203) by Tia Goldenberg at the Associated Press. 

### Google Bard

1. **Modeling the number of wounded:** Assume the number of wounded soldiers can be modeled by a linear function of the form f(t) = mt + b, where t represents the time in days since the start of the conflict and m and b are constants. 
  
   - Based on the information in the article, what can you determine about the signs of m and b? Explain your reasoning.
   - Can you estimate the values of m and b based on the information available? If so, provide your estimates and explain your assumptions. <br>
  
2. **Projecting the future:** Use your model to predict the number of wounded soldiers in 30 days, 60 days, and 90 days from now.
Interpret your results in the context of the situation.

3. **Challenge:** PTSD cases are expected to increase over time. How can you incorporate this into your model to make it more realistic?
   - Consider the limitations of your model. What factors might affect the number of wounded soldiers that are not captured by your linear function?

This problem is a simplified model of a complex real-world situation. However, it can help us to understand the potential impact of the conflict and the importance of providing support to wounded soldiers.

### Solution

1. Model the Wounded

I will write a two linear functions to represent to model the wounded Israeli and Palestenian soilders over time. 

Israel’s Defense Ministry says roughly 3,000 members of the country’s security forces have been wounded since Hamas militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7. (Goldenberg, 2023)

I must find the rate in which the number of wounded (y) increases per day (x) using the formula for slope:

$$ m = \dfrac{(y_2 - y_1)}{(x_2 - x_1)} $$

October 7, 2023 = Assumed first day of Israel-Hamas War = Day 1 =  /(x\_1/)

December 28, 2023 = Date of article publication = Day 52 = $x_2$
