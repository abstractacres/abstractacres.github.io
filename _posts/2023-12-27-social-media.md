### Intro

My game is weak in the attention economy <br>

Social media addiction competes with my autonomy<br>

We can create, consume, or share<br>

But of lies and echos we must be aware<br>

My longing for friendship I fear the most<br>

When love is a 2-dimensional heart and a liked post<br>

Beyond individual consideration<br>

These platforms play a role in emergency communications <br>

And not-to-forget war documenation <br>

The question is: What is our relationship with technology with the potential to distribute timely and important information? <br>

### Body

Most of us aren't trained to evaluate risk, especially under duress<br>

Social media may help or help create mess<br>

Our ability to percieve risk, can be be skewed by fake news<br>

So in times of peace, read-up to sharpen your point-of-view<br>

Authorative information can be hard to understand<br>

Especially instructions written by the "white man" <br>

If 911-systems overload<br>

Digital networks may hold<br>

Depending upon their address<br>

Remember, one may not have internet access<br>

Some don't even own<br> 

Technology like a Smartphone<br>

With privilege take responsibility<br>

Embrace social media's interoperability <br>

While choosing who to trust<br>

NGOs, military, other citizens, whoever is just

Mutual aid efforts are real<br>

Community engagement is a life skill<br>

A disaster is a shooting, terrorist attack, a storm, pandemic, and the unknown<br>

The future doesn't have to faced alone<br>

### Conclusion

In a disaster, social media may be ignored by an experienced survivor  <br>

There is no social media when there is no power<br>

Social media is a compliment to traditional emergency communication infrastructure <br>

It's one of many human-made tools to use today or during an unfortunate conjucture<br>

I desire to interact with Email, VoIP, IM, IT, etc like they are as valuable as they are<br>

They allow me to communicate with loved ones afar<br>
