### Intro

My game is weak in the attention economy <br>

Social media addiction competes with my autonomy<br>

We can create, consume, or share<br>

But of lies and echos we must be aware<br>

My longing for friendship I fear the most<br>

When love is a 2-dimensional heart and a liked post<br>

Beyond individual consideration<br>

These platforms play a role in emergency communications <br>

And not-to-forget war documenation <br>

The question is: What is our relationship with technology with the potential to distribute timely and important information? <br>
