### Intro

At some point in time I broke the my spouse's iPad Air Generation 4. The screen is in tact, but the digitizer needs to be replaced. I made the sketch below this past Wednesday, December 27, in support of my how-to-fix-an-iPad research. It's become an learning oppurtunity under a goal to better understand information technology.  Unfortunately, it's been nearly a year since I first promised to repair the iPad. Frusrated with my slow pace and procrastination, D, my spouse, started to repair the iPad last night. This blogpost is documentation of us finishing the job.

### Process

**Step 1:**D used the opening tool to pry between the edgdes screen and its Rose Gold backing. An adhesive holds the two together. 

Some reccommend to apply a heating element such as a heat gun to warm the adhesive. And alternative to an opening tool one can use sunction cups.
