### Intro

At some point in time I broke the digitizer but not the screen of D's, my spouse's, iPad Air Generation 4. I made the sketch below this past Wednesday, December 27, in support of my how-to-fix-an-iPad research. It's become an learning oppurtunity under a goal to better understand information technology.  Unfortunately, it's been nearly a year since I first promised to repair the iPad. Frusrated with my slow pace and procrastination, D started to repair the iPad last night. This blogpost is documentation of us finishing the job.
