A TLD or Top-Level Domain, such as ".com" for "company" or ".edu" for "education", categorizes a website.  My domain name ends in ".garden" because this website represents my research garden: a handful of potted plants on a lanai in Honolulu. This is the land chance has granted me to further knowledge about the implementation of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in agriculture. 

The following is a list of plants under my care:

Ghost plant, *Graptopetalum paraguayense*

Black prince, *Echeveria*

Prickly Pear, *Opuntia ficus-indica*

Aloe vera

Tree philodendron, *Philodendron bipinnatifidum*

Rubber plant, *Ficus elastica*

Corn plant, *Dracaena fragrans*

Swiss cheese plant, *Monstera deliciosa* 

Fiddle-leaf fig, *Ficus lyrata*

Snake plant, *Sansevieria trifasciata*

ZZ plant, *Zamioculcas zamiifolia*

Additionally, the care in the writing process and website management behind Communicate.garden make it a "digital garden". 

Communicate.garden will document my experience building and implementing ICT in my research garden.  ICTs facilitate the creation, storage, transmission, exchange, and utilization of information. Online marketplaces, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), sensors, and weather monitoring tools are a few examples of ICTs used in agriculture. ICTs can empower farmers with the information needed for decision-making when faced with questions like, "When do we plant?" or "How do we price our crop so it captures most of the market?". This positions ICTs to improve the increase the efficiency, productivity, and sustainability agriculture[^1]. 

Communicate.garden is also a "digital garden" because the way I share information is guided by my values. The idea of a digital garden began with Mark Bernstein’s 1998 essay “Hypertext Gardens”[^2]. "Hypertext Gardens" refer to how hyperlinking changed the structure of a website so that users could better wander and explore. Today, most digital gardens differ from blogs in that they are non-linear, imperfect presentations of one's thoughts over time. Recently, art director, designer, and poet, Annika-Hansteen Izora listed 8 values that guided her understanding of "digital gardens" in her article, "On Digital Gardens: Tending to Our Collective Multiplicity"[^3]. Stewarding a garden and stewarding a mutualistic internet presence both require values, but every gardener is different. The values that guide how I manage and write for Communicate.garden are: accessibility, respect, sustainability, meaningful work, creativity, and accountability. Those who read Communicate.garden gain inspiration to build and implement ICTs for their agricultural projects while supporting my growth and learning not only as an academic but as a human. 

This website fits under the category of ".garden" by its content and structure. Communicate.garden is a digital garden about a research garden.
