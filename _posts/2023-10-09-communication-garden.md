altmediamxr was a series of Zoom conference calls and iglives intended to strengthen student-run media mainly in California. These events began shortly after Californiaâ€™s initial shelter-in-place, March 19, 2020, in response to the Covid-19 Pandemic, and continued with the energy of the Black Lives Matter movement in response to the killing of George Floyd, May 25, 2022.

Today, I changed the @altmediamxr instagram handle to @communication.garden. It bio reads, "Group-read new stories". And it is linked to a [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdaSoI-hJuGuhv8uwtjC1vaVLSO) with the description:

>Guided group reading is a strategy teachers use to help children improve their reading skills. Communication.garden is an Google Meet video conference call and experiment in applying the power of group reading to all ages to help improve our news literacy. By filling this form you consent to being contacted by the host of communication.garden for more information.

My goal is to etch out a vision for communication.garden here.

Although 
- it may cost less time and resources for people to read and watch the news individually
- it is each of our our civic duty to stay informed about the world around us
- taking turns reading a text aloud in a circle is an excercise for children
- it may be preferable to read silently and alone

Reading a few news articles in small groups over Google Meet once week may be another option for those having trouble countering the decreased mental health affects of consuming overwheming amounts traumatic information because

- Together we are stronger than the sum of our individual parts
- online social interaction can feel good
- We benefit from a diversity of of perspectives
- We can hold each other accountable to our civic duty to stay informed about the world around us
- We can remind each other that we are not alone

This project may fail. It must support my academic journey and not cut into the boundaries of study time and other responsibilites. Or it may succeed. Not sure what that looks like.

Today, at the library when I was supposed to studying precalculus I wrote:

What makes posting and viewing images and videos feel so 2-dimensional? Do we have time to live our lives online and offline? Who else is waiting for a permanent connection failure? Do we just want attention with immediate gratification? I'm online because I'm looking for people who would like to group-read the news on a video call. I imagine we'd take a news article and each read a sentence or two. We'd pause to define a word, find a location on a map, put a number into context with related date, or give a momoent of silence for those hurt, hungry, trapped, or dead we learn of.
